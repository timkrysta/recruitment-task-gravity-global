# Backend/Full-stack recruitment task

Frontend and Backend have their own README.md.

## Architecture
I have decided to create a separate backend API in PHP that will be utilized by frontend done in TypeScript and styles in Sass.

Such approach is better that monolith because it's modular; We can replace whole frontend without affecting our backend or reverse.
